I would disagree with whole """"how it is seen by the world"""" statement.  First of all, it will be seen by the world as it presents itself.  I really doubt after they stop using SUNY at Stony Brook, which they just have, that this name will last in anyones memory for long.  I would also point you to some less political references than those you put up, such as the wikipedia article for University at Buffalo, State University of New York.  They did the same thing a while back, and their website uses that designation.  Berkely is the same way.  It is technically UC Berkeley, but that isn't what you see on their website.

It would not be surprising that anything from SUNY head office or whatever it is would continue to use the old designation, but that is politics, and is hardly an area we need to play to here.  If they could stop Stony Brook from changing their name, they would.  No bureaucrat gives up power if they can prevent it.  It is a fait accompli.

IR Explanation

Blessed morning!

This email is regarding the IR issued for the call I received last October 7, 2010, BP Patrice McKenzie.

That afternoon, I was the only one on the queue and prior to Ms. McKenzie's call, I received a MVI call but MVI was not successful due to previous balance as well as the proof of residency required. And because I was the only one on the qeue, I wasn't able to log out or refresh my system.

During the call of Ms. Mckenzie, the POR pop box came and I informed the SME that time, Mario Raymundo, that I have not informed my customer because I know that it was system glitch. Also because tnere is no active account on the address. I was not the one who released the order but someone from Off Line Services. I endorsed the account to Mario to make necessary adjustments on the account. He texted me at around 1am to inform me that he had already talked to someone from OLS and that no POR is really required for the address so, it was released.

After receiving the QA score, I also sent an email to dispute the score that I got because I believe that I did not do anything that is not in accordance with the business rules.
Here are the reasons why:
1. I was the only agent in auto-in for 1hour and 30mins.
2. I informed my support about the situation and I was approved that there is not need to inform the customer of the POR.
3. There is no active account on the address.
4. I was not the one who released the order.

I don't know what adjustments would be made, but I hope there will be considerations.

Thank you!
God bless!
