 You really picked a bad example there.  """"Murder being immoral"""" has not in fact been """"a self-evident truth"""" in all cultures or at all points in history.  And, yes, in most cultures there are situations where you can be held responsible for that over which you had no control.  But that's a tangent itself - the truth of those statements is irrelevant.

Hi Micky, 

Hey, not sure if my last message went out or not. My system sort of froze up for a bit and I could not log back on for a bit.

The gist of what I typed folows:

Not intending to be a smart aleck but the seal, as opposed to the coat of arms doesn't appear in color officially. I think Deb Markowitz, secreatary of stae for Vermont would back up that it is a single color device. I really do like the seal, it was deisgned by Ira Allen, and is refreshingly differnet from most others. Perhaps a trifle naïve in design but a nice device. It was designed to have dies cut for embossing so it is high contrast line art not showing shafiding or multiple colors.  

If you take a look at the staes of Maine, California, Michigan, you note more of a full color with shading and dpeth sort of treatment. these though labled """"seals"""" are all heraldically like a coat of arms. If we look at nations, like the Netherlands, UK, Canda, we see coats of arms. American civic heraldry is different. Vermont like many of our older east coast states has a coat of arms that is described by a statute, what can be called a blazon. Because vermont's coat of arms is so great I would love to see it used somewhere. Maybe as an illustration on the Vermont page, and as its own entry. If the word """"Seal"""" in the sidebar is boiler plate and can not be changed to coat of arms, could we use a solis dark green or medium gray without the color? And, possibly use the more colorful coat of arms, for the state links at botom of page. 

It's a thought. I grew up in Vermont. I see you are from Enlgand. What part? I am doing a signage and branding project in Sevenoaks, Kent at present.

Best,

Jim"""
