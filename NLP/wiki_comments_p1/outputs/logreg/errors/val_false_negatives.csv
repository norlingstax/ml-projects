Hola! I'm trying to find out about the film I just saw and was looking into it. But - there data here which doesn't not exist... It appears the people who have been contributing to this site have it wrong. I will do a bit to correct the posts, but its sad to see how poorly used wikipedia is. ;("

That song is currently getting college airplay on a national level through universal records marketing. I have my own label (assuming that page would get deleted) which is promotion marketing and distribution. I will never sign to a major label. Not that I can't I've been songwriting in the industry over five years and have credits with Atlantic records. Do you want me to screenshot royalty checks? My article was not complete as I did not submit all vital information. I plan on releasing my album and another single with help from universal records in which I am aiming higher. How can I become more notable in your eyes to permit my wiki? When will I be valid to you?

Encyclopaedia Britannica has the date that this Act was passed as May 15, 1830. – 

Good catch. The difference lies between """"passed"""" and """"signed"""": the House passed the Act on May 26, but Jackson signed it on May 28. I have no idea how or why May 26 came to be a Wikipedia """"selected anniversary,"""" but the signing is probably the more significant date. Regardless, I'll clarify the dates in the article.  23:31, May 25, 2005 (UTC)

ugh. someone edited the main page, please retype the facts...  """

You Christians and Muslims gained all your territories by right of conquest and thinks it's okay, yet you think Jews are evil Nazis when they do the same thing.

You are obviously British, and you sound like a Communist. Communists are just as evil and very similar to Nazis. You are the ones who started the slavery in the Americas in the first place. You are the ones who illegally colonized and occupied the world in the first place. You are the ones who made it illegal for Jews to return to Israel and denied them entry into Britain and British colonies during World War II, thus helping the Germans carry out the Holocaust. Furthermore, you show yourself to be a typical anti-Semite. You lie and say that Jews colonized Israel. Jews did not colonize Israel. Jews returned to Israel. The Arabs were the ones who illegally colonized and continue to illegally occupy Israel. Nableezy is also an anti-Semite. He is an Arab supremacist and claims that Israel is “genocidal, Jewish supremacist, racist, terrorism sponsor, human rights violater (sic), misogynist, fanatic, and repressive.” Europeans and Muslims should not be allowed to edit articles about Jews. I suggest you cease and desist from defaming Jews and withdraw yourselves from the so-called “WikiProject Israel Palestine Collaboration.”"
