0,1,1.4267213740234876,30835,1.4267213740234876,"Tracey Temple's highly intimate, intrusive and personal comments about Prescott have been widely reproduced by bloggers and sections of the media because of their titillation value, and, unfortunately, titillation sells, despite being very unpleasant for the victim. Perhaps his behaviour deserved these intimate revelations, but that is not for Wikipedia to judge. Bloggers, tabloids and columnists are, as we all know, highly partial. I do not see how a Wikipedia biography can reproduce such intimate revelations without breaching the spirit of its neutrality. Btw whether the Winterton allegations are appropriate is open to question; reproduction of media speculation about unverifiable allegations does not seem to be within Wikipedia's biography guidelines. But others can decide whether or not to delete these."

He's more Russian than he will ever know, something you will never understand.  He knows, he really knows, while most never come close to reaching a true understanding.  He may have the strangest face I've even seen on this planet, but he has a brain, a very powerful brain, and that is often a rare thing to discover here at Wikipedia.  What I find most laughable is that so many Wiki editors stick tags on certain listings and threaten removal but they rarely act on their threats.  They usually only throw out a listing if they get offended personally, like little girls who get so upset because a boy throws mud on their face. LOL   Falcon, you can remove info, you can stick all the tags you want on Wiki listings, but those who know what real music happens to be do not care.  They know the difference between mediocre Coldplay and quality. They have learned the true reasons why material is thrown away or tags are applied, and they know that in most cases, those kinds of actions are meaningless.  I've seen listings here on Wikipedia that have had the same tags for years, and nothing more ever happened.  In fact, when I see a listing tagged, that tells me that the listing is probably of such high quality that certain jealous editors felt they had to deface it, so it deserves even more tribute.  I speak the Truth, Falcon, and I know you don't like to hear the Truth, but there it is."

I agree that this is a marketing term, but it was applied in describing this market segment by numerous reputable sources from its onset. Of course, the EPA and DOT were not established at that time, thus it is impossible to have them """"define"""" this class of vehicle retroactively. Today's pony car ancestors are all lumped in with more generic automobile classifications. In summary, I do not think that pony cars belong in the """"sports car"""" classification. Moreover, the """"sports"""" term has been depreciated and is currently used to classify almost anything: sedans, station wagons, ragtops, the now infamous SUVs, etc. —   """

 A request 

I ask that you consider taking time away from posting on WT:V or the subpage. Your posts there, particularly the multiple polls, became disruptive several weeks ago, and the page has basically ground to a halt because of it. I took six weeks off from editing either the policy or the talk page—from around June 20 until August 7—just to make sure other people's voices were heard equally, so I hope you'll consider doing the same. If your proposals are truly supported, they won't be affected by your absence.  TALK|CONTRIBS 

I agree that the main talk page needs a breather from this whole topic.  And I'm ready for quiet work on it in an obscure place for a while.  If you want that to not be the subpage, that's fine with me but I just said there that I went along with the subpage idea.  Sincerely,  North8000  

The main talk page needs a long, long breather. But I think you need a breather too from this topic, partly for your own sake, but also to see whether it has legs without you. At things stand, you're doing two things simultaneously (and in something of a contradiction): keeping it going, and strengthening opposition to it because of the overkill. If you would let it be, you would see whether it has legs of its own. Anyway, just a request.  TALK|CONTRIBS 

I'm ready to slip into low key """"homework"""" on this, even without a request.  Me suggesting that we adopt the first sentence just proposed/suggested by Jimbo Wales was a sort of special departure from that, I saw that as acting more as a facilitator.  I noticed that somebody tried to hide the fact that it was HIS suggestion by changing the section title. North8000  

But not before reverting and continuing to disrupt. You are posting an inherently POV poll; RfCs are supposed to be neutrally worded. I give up on you because it is pointless.  TALK|CONTRIBS 

 I don't think that it is POV to say who wrote the proposed wording.  That was the original title of the section, it's the title that people commented under, and it provides the information of who wrote it.   Since when in Wikipedia does saying the source of something get called """"POV'ing"""" it? And don't forget there is a second dimension to this.  I put up HIS suggestion, and people are removing the fact that it was HIS suggestion simultaneously with villianizing me for putting (it) up a suggestion on the first sentence.  I call that dirty pool.  But, as I said, I put it it up as a facilitator, and don't plan to further advocate it.  North8000  """

Just because it was filmed in Spain, doesn't mean its Spanish."
